# Supply Chain Data Analysis (Work in Progress)

This project focuses on analyzing a small supply chain dataset to uncover key insights related to product performance, supplier efficiency, and operational trends.

## Dataset Overview
The dataset contains 23 columns covering various supply chain aspects such as:
- **Product & Pricing** – Product type, SKU, Price, Revenue generated  
- **Inventory & Sales** – Availability, Stock levels, Number of products sold  
- **Logistics** – Shipping carriers, Transportation modes, Routes, Costs  
- **Manufacturing & Quality** – Lead times, Manufacturing costs, Defect rates, Inspection results  
- **Customer Information** – Demographics and location data  

## Current Progress
- Columns standardized and formatted consistently  
- Null values and duplicates checked (none found)  
- Relationships validated between key metrics (e.g., revenue = price × quantity)  
- Data type and category optimization done  
- Basic feature engineering implemented (e.g., Profit, Profit Margin)  
- Further sanity checks and categorical balance analysis planned  

## Next Steps
- Perform detailed **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
- Visualize supplier and product performance  
- Investigate lead time vs. revenue and defect rate relationships  
- Create summary insights and possible dashboard visuals  

## Goal
The goal of this project is to practice end-to-end data cleaning, validation, and exploratory analysis using a realistic supply chain dataset.

## Tools & Libraries
- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib / Seaborn / Plotly  

## Status
 *Project is currently under Process.*
